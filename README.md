# Webcam Surveillance System

This project is a simple surveillance system that uses a webcam to detect movements.

## Features

- Detects movements in a selected area of the webcam video.
- Sounds an alarm if it detects movement.
- Allows adjusting the sensitivity of the motion detection.
- Allows adjusting the alarm interval (how long between consecutive alarms).
- Allows adjusting the motion check interval.
- Saves the settings and the selected area between sessions using localStorage.

## Usage

1. Open the `camera.html` file in your browser. The other files should be in the same directory.
2. Allow the browser to access your webcam.
3. Select an area in the webcam video to monitor for motion.
4. Adjust the sensitivity, the alarm interval, and the check interval as needed.
5. If the system detects movement in the selected area, it will sound an alarm.
